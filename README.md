# Logger

## Changelog

+ **0.2.6:**

	- Added Readme.
	- Added support for calling the error logging function (Logger.e()) with an Exception instead of a text message. The Logger will then log the Exception's class' SimpleName, a colon and a space, and the Exception's Message. The other logging functions may also receive this functionality.
+ **0.2.5:** 

	- Initial Git version.
